        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to provide rural women in Uganda with the skills, tools, and opportunities they need to build sustainable livelihoods through agriculture and entrepreneurship. By equipping women with these resources, we aim to close the gender gap and support economic growth.</p>

        <h2>Gender Equality</h2>
        <p>In Uganda, women face significant barriers to achieving financial independence, including limited access to land, education, and capital. This project seeks to eliminate these barriers and empower women to become active participants in Ugandaâ€™s economy.</p>
